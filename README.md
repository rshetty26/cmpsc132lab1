The function "frequency" takes a phrase and counts the frequency of each character and returns it in a dictionary.

The function "invert" flips the key and value pairs. Afterwards, if a key repeats, it takes all the associated values and concatenates it into a list and associates that as the new value for a single key.

The function "employee_update" takes a record of employee and assigns a bonus based on their time worked over years.
